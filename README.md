Scheduler is an application designed for automatic scheduling of school class timetables. The problem of scheduling school classes is a complex optimization task, involving assigning lectures to available time slots, rooms, and student groups while minimizing violations of time and logistical constraints.
The scheduling of school classes poses a challenging optimization problem due to the need to balance various constraints and preferences. Traditional genetic algorithm techniques for mutation and crossover were found inadequate for handling the complexity of school scheduling data. As a result, this project introduces novel mutation strategies that resemble lab-driven mutations rather than evolutionary principles. This approach allows for more directed improvements in the schedule rather than random changes.
